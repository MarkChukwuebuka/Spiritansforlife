    <h4>WHO ARE SPIRITANS FOR LIFE?</h4>
    <h5>“SPIRITANS FOR LIFE” is a pro-life movement, and an association of seminarians (of the CONGREGATION OF THE HOLY FATHERS AND BROTHERS, seeking to be future Roman Catholic priests) who have chosen to live chastely and to promote, protect, defend and respect the dignity and sanctity of human life from conception to natural death, in other words, this movement challenges seminarians and members of related movements in other institutions to chastity, urges them to promulgate the awareness of pro-life values and virtue in their fellow seminarians/students, and spurs them on to promote, defend, protect and respect human life.</h5><br>
    <h3>Is this association relevant?</h3>
    <h3>Yes!</h3>
    <h6>1.	Because of unprecedented moral decay that constantly harasses youthful innocence and conjugal fidelity.<br><br>
    2.	Because of revolt against life itself, manifested in abortion, contraception, sterilization and suicide, etc.<br><br>
    3.	Because of increase in prostitution, rape, seduction and sexual harassment in secondary school and higher institution of learning.<br><br>
    4.	Because youths need to rediscover the spiritual energy and the freedom to live and grow in modesty and chastity.<h6><br>
    <h5>As “corrupt sex educators” go around seducing teenagers/youth into sexual irresponsibility by promoting contraceptives as solution to the problem of teenage pregnancy, abortion, AIDs and STDS, the “SPIRITANS FOR LIFE” as “a lamp on a house-top” goes about promoting chastity and sexual self-control, to solve these problems and more. Our sexuality is a gift from God. Guided by the church, ‘SPIRITANS FOR LIFE’ brings the true and correct teachings of sex education to their fellow youths, so that all of us can live according to Gods plan for our sexuality. Truth cannot be passed over in silence; a beacon should not be extinguished. We have to speak of chastity courageously, although the word itself is no longer part of our modern way of speaking. We cannot afford “to go along in order to get along.’</h5><br>


    <h4>OUR BASIS OF ACTION</h4>
    <h3>A.	Dignity and sanctity of human life</h3>
    <h6>
    1. That God is the author of life.<br><br>
    2. That man is made in the image of God.<br><br>
  3. That life is sacred from conception to natural death.<br><br>
  4. That everybody, from conception is endowed with equal dignity.</br><br>
    5. That God has not given anybody any permission to take away life at whatever stage of life</br><br>
  6. That contraceptive of any kind, sterilization, and other devices capable of destroying life or preventing any life giving potential are serious offences against life and God the author of life.</br><br>
    7. That the present attacks against life, especially the life of the unborn child constitute a serious offence against God and his authority over life.</br><br>
    8. That as Christian youths and students, we have to speak out against the atrocities.<br><br>
    </h6><br>


    <h3>B. Chastity:</h3>
    <h6>
    1. Our sexuality is a gift from God.</br><br>
    2. God created sex for marriage.</br><br>
    3. Sexual intercourse is a sacred act; it is not fun.</br><br>
    4. It is a special; wedding gift.</br><br>
    5. It is an expression of love between husband and wife.</br><br>
    6. It brings about new life.</br><br>
    7. It unites husbands and wives.</h6></br>
    <h3>Since we are unmarried, the above facts which we strongly believe spur us on to:</h3>
    <h6>1. Refrain from all sexual activities.</h6><br>
    </ol>


    <h4>OBJECTIVES<h4>

    2. To work towards reduction of sexual promiscuity among teenagers/youths in secondary schools and higher institutions of learning.</br><br>
    3. To fight against ALL artificial methods of birth control and “corrupt sex education’ in schools.</br><br>
    4. To fight against abortion.</h6></br>

    <h3>Our Long term objectives:</h3>
    <h6>
    1. Deeper knowledge of God and holiness of life.</br><br>
    2. Good Christian family life.</br><br>
    3. Marital fidelity.</br><br>
    4. Fidelity in celibate and religious life.<h6></br><br>


    <h4>OUR MISSION</h4>

    <h5>“SPIRITANS FOR LIFE” has its special mission to accomplish in the Church. The Second Vatican Council recommends strongly ‘like-to-like apostolate” as one of the effective means of challenging people to responsible living out of their Christian values. (Cf. Vat. II: Apostolicam Actuositaem, no 13).</h5><br>

    <h5>Hence, practically the movement is up to the following:</h5>

    <h6>
    1. Prays in reparation for desecration of human in all its forms; for stopping abortion, and the use of contraceptives, and for appreciation of the dignity and sanctity of human life by all.</br><br>
    2. challenges fellow students and youth to chastity until marriage or through consecrated life.</br><br>
    3. discourages fellow students and youth from the use of contraceptives, and from having abortions.</br><br>
    4. discourages unmarried mothers from killing their babies and encourage them to carry their pregnancy to term.</br><br>
    5. spreads the disastrous consequences of contraceptive devices and abortion.</br><br>
    6. Directs or send unmarried mothers to those who take Special care of them.</br><br>
    7. Distributes pro-chastity/pro-life materials among fellow students and youths.</br><br>
    8. Gives talks, seminars, conferences, workshops on chastity and the protection of human life in schools/parishes.</br><br>
    9. Spreads the negative consequences of drugs and alcohol abuse.</br><br>
    10. Seeks to condemn other means of attack against life e.g “secret cults” in schools and parishes.</br><br>
    11. Spreads this message through the media: secular and religious newspapers/ magazines, radio and television, programs, handbills (flyers) pamphlets, audio cassettes.</br><br>
    12. produces a newsletter quarterly, monthly, bi-monthly.</br><br>
    13. Organized peaceful march protests in our locality. etc.</br><br>
    Above all, your life of personal witness is very important. It is rightly said that “action speaks louder than voice,” hence you can change many lives through your way of life. Members have to be serious about this. Remember that you cannot give what you don’t have.</h6><br>


    <h4>EXTRA-ORDINARY ACTIVITIES</h4>
    <h6>
    1. Seminar/Workshop/Leadership course formembers, possibly, yearly.</br><br>
    2. Annual Retreat during long vocation.</br><br>
    3. Rosary March for Life once or twice a year.</br><br>
    4. Prayer Vigil for Life once or twice or more often.</br><br>

    7. Excursions to some places of interest are encouraged at week-ends or during the long Vacation.</br><br>
    8. Pro-life enlightenment week.</br><br>
    9. Music for life Music for Life concerts are encouraged where outsiders are invited youths and adults alike. Acquisition of guitars or music band can help to realize this. Beautiful pro-life tunes, and/or other life enhancing songs can be appealing to youths, and very powerful in passing on the pro-chastity/pro-life messages. Members are encouraged to make this a reality.</h6><br>
